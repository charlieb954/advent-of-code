# Advent of Code (Python)

## Description 

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of
Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges, implemented in Python. My goal is
to solve each day's puzzle quickly using only the Python standard library.

The repository is organised by year, day and will contain the input file as well
as 2 .py files for the solutions.

I have attempted AoC since 2022, but due to time constraints - I don't get far!

## How to execute a solution

To run a solution for a specific day:

1. Navigate to the day's directory

```bash
cd 2024/day-1
```
2. Execute the Python script:

```bash
python3 part1.py
```

3. The result will be printed in the terminal
